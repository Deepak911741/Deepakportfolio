        UX Designer (User Experience Designer):</li><br>
        
        <li>A UX designer focuses on the overall user experience and how users interact with the website or application.
        They conduct research and gather insights about the target users to understand their needs, behaviors, and pain points.</li><br>
        <li>UX designers create wireframes, prototypes, and user flows to design the user journey and interactions.
        The goal of a UX designer is to optimize the user experience, making the website or app easy to navigate, intuitive, and enjoyable to use.</li><br>
        <li>While UI and UX design are distinct roles, they often overlap, especially in smaller teams or projects. Many designers may work as both UI and UX designers, and having skills in both areas is valuable for creating well-rounded and successful digital products.</li><br>
        
        <li>Key skills for UI designers may include proficiency in graphic design tools (e.g., Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, Sketch), understanding of color theory, typography, and design principles.<br>
        
        <li>Key skills for UX designers may include user research and testing methodologies, wireframing and prototyping skills (using tools like Sketch, Figma, Adobe XD, etc.), and a deep understanding of user-centered design. </li><br>
        
        <li>In larger design teams or more complex projects, separate UI and UX designers may collaborate closely to achieve the best results in terms of both visual aesthetics and user experience. </li><br><br>
